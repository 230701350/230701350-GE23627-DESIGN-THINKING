                            <p>Color Vision Deficiency (CVD), commonly referred to as color blindness, affects
                                approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women worldwide. It's a condition where
                                individuals have difficulty distinguishing certain colors or perceiving color
                                differences.</p>
                            <p>Most cases of CVD are genetic and present from birth, but some can be acquired through
                                eye diseases, certain medications, or aging. CVD occurs when one or more of the three
                                types of cone cells in the retina (responsible for color perception) are absent or
                                function abnormally.</p>
                            <p>While "color blindness" is a common term, true color blindness (seeing only in shades of
                                gray) is extremely rare. Most people with CVD can see colors but have difficulty
                                differentiating between particular color pairs.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Can color vision deficiency be cured?</h4>
                        <p>Currently, there is no cure for inherited color vision deficiency. However, if the condition
                            is caused by certain medications or eye diseases, treating the underlying cause may improve
                            color vision. For inherited CVD, assistive technologies like ChromaVision and specialized
                            glasses can help enhance color perception, but they do not cure the condition.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>How is color vision deficiency diagnosed?</h4>
                        <p>The most common diagnostic tool is the Ishihara Color Test, which consists of a series of
                            colored plates with numbers or patterns visible to those with normal color vision but
                            difficult or impossible to see for those with CVD. Other tests include the
                            Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test, which measures color discrimination more precisely, and the
                            anomaloscope, which can determine the exact type and severity of red-green color deficiency.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Can women have color vision deficiency?</h4>
                        <p>Yes, though it's less common. Color vision deficiency is primarily inherited as an X-linked
                            recessive trait. Since women have two X chromosomes, they need to inherit the gene from both
                            parents to express the condition, which is why it affects only about 0.5% of women compared
                            to 8% of men. Women can also be carriers, meaning they have one normal X chromosome and one
                            with the CVD gene, allowing them to pass the condition to their sons.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>How does ChromaVision differ from color-correcting glasses?</h4>
                        <p>Color-correcting glasses use specific lens filters to alter the wavelengths of light entering
                            the eye, enhancing color contrast for people with CVD. ChromaVision, on the other hand, uses
                            digital image processing algorithms to modify colors in images and video feeds. The key
                            differences are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ChromaVision is customizable for different types and severities of CVD</li>
                            <li>Digital correction can be applied selectively to specific images or scenes</li>
                            <li>ChromaVision can provide educational simulations and detailed color information</li>
                            <li>The software approach doesn't require wearing any special eyewear</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Both solutions have their advantages, and some people may benefit from using both in
                            different situations.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Are there careers that people with CVD should avoid?</h4>
                        <p>Some careers do have color vision requirements due to safety concerns or job requirements.
                            These may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Commercial airline pilots (strict color vision requirements)</li>
                            <li>Electrical work (color-coded wires)</li>
                            <li>Military service (varies by branch and role)</li>
                            <li>Certain types of design work (graphic design, fashion)</li>
                            <li>Quality control in color-critical industries</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, with technological aids like ChromaVision and increasing accommodations in the
                            workplace, many of these fields are becoming more accessible. Each case should be evaluated
                            individually based on the specific type and severity of CVD and the exact job requirements.
